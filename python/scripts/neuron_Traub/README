This is a README for this folder, containing sample simulation data from Traubs model, generated by Helena Glabska.

The simulation data is contained in the following structure

input.dat
output.dat
time.dat
log2014042810:46:30.txt
/i
    /i/iout0.dat (corresponding to core, in real data 512 cores)
    /i/iout1.dat
	/i/tmp/0.dat (corresponding to cell number, in real data 2500 odd files)
	/i/tmp/1.dat
	/i/tmp/2.dat	
/v
    /v/oout0.dat
    /v/oout1.dat
	/v/tmp/0.dat
	/v/tmp/1.dat
	/v/tmp/2.dat

CAUTION:
The data here is incomplete. These are here only to serve as an example of what each of the original dump files looked like.
The code provided may not work with incomplete data, but was tested to work on the complete datasets.

Work flow:
1) use reformat.sh to generate /i/tmp/* files from the data of iout0.dat etc 
2) use test_neuron_Traub.py to generate the complete file in the NSDF file format.
3) use test_neuron_Traub_spikes.py to generate different flavours of the "event" data storage.
