#README Written by Chintaluri Chaitanya

This folder contains the relevant examples for the NSDF file format
In all cases, we utilize the NSDF Python library.

The output of these scripts (NSDF files) are available here:
http://www.bit.ly/nsdf

1) poolroom.py is an case considering non-neuroscience data testing for the
   agnosticism and versatality in this format.  considers the case of liesure
   center, with pool rooms, each having multiple pool tables. In this case there
   is no hierarchy, and we utilize /model/modeltree to represent the model
   information.

2) hodgkin_huxley.py is the simplest possible case of HH models from
   Neuroscience simulations. Running this generates 3 files. We show how to
   store membrane potential obtained from the soma of a cell, also shows how to
   store data from the channels.

3) test_brian.py is the case where we show how to store spiking data obtain from
   Brian simulator. Requires Brian simulator.  Generates 3 files. Code for
   storing the data using native h5py is also included. We store the spikes
   obtained, we also show different dialects in which it is possible to save
   this data.

4) traub2005.py - WARNING : Running this generates large files!  is an example
   of complete data obtained from simulations. Generates 6 large files. We
   store, Vms, Ims, spikes, etc. We also test different dialets possible with
   nonuniform and compressions.

5) external_model.py: For linking to external hdf5 files, which contain specific
   data. and yet complying with the nsdf format.

6) neuron_Hay/test_neuron_Hay.py is the case of an actual simulation, this
   requires Neuron installed with python, generates 1 file.  most of the program
   here is to obtain the currents from all the compartments. We show how to save
   the data from current injection, injection location, etc.

7) moose_Multi/multi1.py is the case from Moose demos, it generates 1
   file. Requires MOOSE/asyn13 installed We show how to save multidimensional
   data (voxel, property, time) in uniform, while saving Ca dynamics

8) moose_NeuroML/granulecell_neuroml.py is the case to iillustrate the NeuroML
   fileinclusion inside NSDF. Requires MOOSE/asyn13 installed.  This example is
   taken from Moose demos. This case is applicaple when user wishes to provide
   the code that generated the output.

9) moose_NeuroML/granulecell_incremental_writing.py is the case to show,
   incremental writing, same example as the previous.

10) datadump/test_parse_datadump.py and datadump/test_parse_datadump_spikes.py is
    the case when user wants to process existing data into NSDF. Requires pandas
    python package.  This is partial data, and is only meant as illustrative of
    possible effecient operations.

11) test_connections.py illustrates how to save information related to
    connectivity, we show two differnt options for saving this data. The user may	
    prefer which ever suits their need. Both the formats shown are permitted withing
    nsdf

12) STEPS/diffusion_boundary.py illustrates an example for the STEPS simulator - taken
    from the tutorials of STEP solver 2.2.0/examples/tutorial/diffusion_boundary.py
